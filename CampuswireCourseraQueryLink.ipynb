       "\"[SOUND]This lecture is the first oneabout the text clustering. In this lecture, we are going totalk about the text clustering. This is a very important technique fordoing topic mining and analysis. In particular, in this lecture we're going to start withsome basic questions about the clustering. And that is, what is text clustering andwhy we are interested in text clustering. In the following lectures, we are goingto talk about how to do text clustering. How to evaluate the clustering results? So what is text clustering? Well, clustering actually isa very general technique for data mining as you might havelearned in some other courses. The idea is to discover naturalstructures in the data. In another words,we want to group similar objects together. In our case, these objects are of course,text objects. For example, they can be documents,terms, passages, sentences, or websites, and then I'llgo group similar text objects together. So let's see an example, well, hereyou don't really see text objects, but I just used some shapes to denoteobjects that can be grouped together. Now if I ask you, what are some naturalstructures or natural groups where you, if you look at it and you might agree thatwe can group these objects based on chips, or their locations on thistwo dimensional space. So we got the three clusters in this case. And they may not be somuch this agreement about these three clusters but it really dependson the perspective to look at the objects. Maybe some of you have also seenthing in a different way, so we might get different clusters. And you'll see another exampleabout this ambiguity more clearly. But the main point of here is, the problemis actually not so well defined. And the problem lies inhow to define similarity. And what do you mean by similar objects? Now this problem has to be clearly defined in order to havea well defined clustering problem. And the problem is in general that any two objects can be similardepending on how you look at them. So for example, this will keptthe two words like car and horse. So are the two words similar? Well, it depends on how ifwe look at the physical properties of car andhorse they are very different but if you look at them functionally,a car and a horse, can both be transportation tools. So in that sense, they may be similar. So as we can see, it really depends onour perspective, to look at the objects. And so it ought to makethe clustering problem well defined. A user must define the perspective forassessing similarity. And we call this perspectivethe clustering bias. And when you define a clustering problem,it's important to specify your perspective forsimilarity or for defining the similarity that will beused to group similar objects. because otherwise,the similarity is not well defined and one can have differentways to group objects. So let's look at the example here. You are seeing some objects,or some shapes, that are very similar to what youhave seen on the first slide, but if I ask you to group these objects,again, you might feel there is more than herethan on the previous slide. For example, you might think, well, we can steer a group by ships, so that wouldgive us cluster that looks like this. However, you might also feel that, well, maybe the objects can begrouped based on their sizes. So that would give us a different wayto cluster the data if we look at the size andlook at the similarity in size. So as you can see clearly here,depending on the perspective, we'll get different clustering result. So that also clearly tells us that inorder to evaluate the clustering without, we must use perspective. Without perspective, it's very hard todefine what is the best clustering result. So there are many examplesof text clustering setup. And so for example, we can clusterdocuments in the whole text collection. So in this case,documents are the units to be clustered. We may be able to cluster terms. In this case, terms are objects. And a cluster of terms can be used todefine concept, or theme, or a topic. In fact, there's a topic models that youhave seen some previous lectures can give you cluster of terms in somesense if you take terms with high probabilities from word distribution. Another example is just to cluster anytext segments, for example, passages, sentences, or any segments that you canextract the former larger text objects. For example, we might extract the ordertext segments about the topic, let's say, by using a topic model. Now once we've got thosetext objects then we can cluster the segments that we've got to discover interesting clusters thatmight also ripple in the subtopics. So this is a case of combining textclustering with some other techniques. And in general you willsee a lot of text mining can be accurate combined ina flexible way to achieve the goal of doing more sophisticatedmining and analysis of text data. We can also cluster fairlylarge text objects and by that, I just mean text objects maycontain a lot of documents. So for example, we might cluster websites. Each website is actuallycompose of multiple documents. Similarly, we can also cluster articleswritten by the same author, for example. So we can trigger all the articlespublished by also as one unit for clustering. In this way, we might group authorstogether based on whether they're published papers or similar. For the more text clusters will be forthe cluster to generate a hierarchy. That's because we can in general clusterany text object at different levels. So more generally why istext clustering interesting? Well, it's because it's a veryuseful technique for text mining, particularly exploratory text analysis. And so a typical scenario is thatyou were getting a lot of text data, let's say all the email messagesfrom customers in some time period, all the literature articles, etc. And then you hope to get a senseabout what are the overall content of the connection, so for example,you might be interested in getting a sense about major topics,or what are some typical or representative documentsin the connection. And clustering to helpus achieve this goal. We sometimes also want to linka similar text objects together. And these objects might beduplicated content, for example. And in that case, such a technique can help us removeredundancy and remove duplicate documents. Sometimes they are aboutthe same topic and by linking them together we can havemore complete coverage of a topic. We may also used text clustering to createa structure on the text data and sometimes we can create a hierarchy of structuresand this is very useful for problems. We may also use text clustering to induceadditional features to represent text data when we cluster documents together,we can treat each cluster as a feature. And then we can say whena document is in this cluster and then the feature value would be one. And if a document is not in this cluster,then the feature value is zero. And this helps provide additionaldiscrimination that might be used for text classification aswe will discuss later. So there are, in general,many applications of text clustering. And I just thought oftwo very specific ones. One is to cluster search results, for example, [INAUDIBLE] search enginecan cluster such results so that the user can see overall structureof the results of return the fall query. And when the query's ambiguous thisis particularly useful because the clusters likely representdifferent senses of ambiguous word. Another application is to understand themajor complaints from customers based on their emails, right. So in this case,we can cluster email messages and then find in the majorclusters from there, we can understand what are the majorcomplaints about them. [MUSIC]\""
